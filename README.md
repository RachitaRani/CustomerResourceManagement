❖ Project: Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System
❖ Description: A Customer Relationship Management (CRM)is a system that enables 
businesses to manage and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the customer 
lifecycle. The system will allow businesses to improve customer relationships, enhance 
customer retention, and drive sales growth. The CRM system will include functionalities for 
contact management, sales management, task management, and customer support.

In this Project, I have:
 Designed the user interface of the CRM system using Angular.
 Ensured the platform is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
 Implemented features such as contact management, sales pipeline tracking, task 
management, and customer support ticketing.
 Developed the server-side logic using Java frameworks like Spring Boot.
 Set up RESTful APIs to handle client-server communication for managing contacts, sales, 
tasks, and support tickets.
 Implement features such as user authentication, authorization.
 Design and create a relational database schema to store contact information, sales records, 
tasks, and support tickets.
 Use technologies like JPA (Java Persistence API) and PostgreSQL to interact with the database 
from the Java application.

Future aspects:
 Implement add-on features such as Session Management
 Integrate email and notification services to keep users updated on task deadlines and 
support ticket statuses.
